Guzzle-Ring
===========

Provides lower-level APIs used to power HTTP clients and servers through a
simple, PHP ``callable`` that accepts a request hash and returns a future
response hash. Guzzle-Ring is inspired by Clojure's `Ring <https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring>`_,
but modified to accommodate both clients and servers for both blocking and
non-blocking requests.

See http://guzzle-ring.readthedocs.org/ for the full online documentation.
